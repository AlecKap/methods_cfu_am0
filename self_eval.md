# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
    - I feel like i am getting more and more confident as time goes on, but they can be complex and multifaceted so i am still learning.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
    - Again, i think that i am getting the concepts, just need to keep practicing.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
    - Can one create large complex methods and employ them throughout large projects to basically consolidate work flow and be more ?
    i love mod 0
